## Question 1

Was written in Python, I have used the given correct lists to create a dictionary

Then I itereated over the actual sold items with their prices and counted the errors according to the dictionary

## Question 2

Was tested on PostgreSQL, I created the tables, then I selected the department name and counted the employees.

I used a LEFT JOIN to return all records from the left table (EMPLOYEE), and the matching records from the right table (DEPARTMENT)

Then I sorted by number of employees and alphabetically order

## Question 3

Was written in Python, for each digit return the sum of the least significant digit and call recursively divided by 10 without the remainder

Note: negative numbers will return the same sum of digits regardless to their negativity

## Question 4

Was written in Python, getting input from the user and for each new temporary maximum candidate we set its count to 1.

If we get another number like our current maximum we increment its count.

When we get 0 we stop reading so for example for the next input: `1 -2 3 4 4 0 5 6 7`

The output will be the following Tuple: `(4, 2)` since we stopped reading after 0
